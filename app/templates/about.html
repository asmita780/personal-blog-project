        <h2>About this project</h2>

        <p>This web application was created as part of my learning journey in web development</p>

        <br>
        <p>
            The main purpose of this project is to understand how backend and frontend technologies work together. 
            It uses Python with Flask for server-side logic, SQLAlchemy for database management, and HTML/CSS for the user interface.
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>
            Through this project, I have learned about authentication, database relationships, form handling, and responsive design.
            It is not just an application, but a practical experiment to improve my understanding of full-stack development.
